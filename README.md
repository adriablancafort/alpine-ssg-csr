## Astro SSR and Alpine CSR with Astro Components

This project is a Proof of Concept to see if it was possible to hack Astro.js components and render them with the build process (Static Site Generation) and on the client by using Astro.js framework (Client Side Rendering). The challange was that Astro components do not support CSR. They are specifically designed for SSG and SSR (https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components). It's not the optimal way to do it but I was just curious to know if it was possible. And it turns out it is.

## Technologies Used
